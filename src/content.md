When I read the application for **Staff Software Engineer** I was shocked: I could get paid for working with ASTs, bundlers, transpilers, and TypeScript?!

After the initial shock settled down, I took a serious look at the position and got even more excited. My entire development career (dare I say, life?) I've been interested in the exact things that the **Staff Software Engineer** position is about. I've always been interested in the more going deep into the tools and the low-level parts of the web, I've ventured into open source (although admittedly not as much as I would've liked), I've had a passion for detail and quality and I've been using Tailwind for quite some time while focussing on DX for the teams I've led.

Thank you for taking the time to read my application. Please bear with me while we dive a little deeper into the interests mentioned above.

## Going deep

My interest in development started at a very young age. I think I was around 10 when I started toying with PowerPoint. Yes, PowerPoint was my gateway drug into software development. I discovered you could create links to other slides, so I could present a user with a choice and take them to a different part of the storyline based on the choice they made. Combine this with the ability to create over-the-top animations and I was hooked.

To me, this illustrates that my general interest in using (or abusing) tools to create something new started from a very young age. Paired with a constant curiosity and a desire to understand how things work you might come to understand why software engineering was a natural fit for me.

Skipping through high school (where I taught programming to fellow students), my time studying computer science at [Eindhoven University](https://www.tue.nl/en/), a startup, and 7 years of experience working at agencies, I'm currently leading an innovation project at [Incentro](https://incentro.com/) (my current employer), where we're building a toolset for developers to quickly build headless e-commerce sites.

This project (called `micro.nova`) focuses on reusing the logic between e-commerce sites. So, where Tailwind and Tailwind UI help us with styling, and Headless UI helps us with functionality and accessibility, `micro.nova` will offer a set of reusable components that implement the data fetching and logic parts of an e-commerce site. My day-to-day work now involves working on CLI tools, manipulating GraphQL ASTs, writing extensive documentation, setting up build pipelines (in GH Actions), creating data-fetching tools for React, writing plugins for codegen tools like [GraphQL Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen), etc.
