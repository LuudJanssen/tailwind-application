When I read the application for **Staff Software Engineer** I was shocked: I could get paid for working with ASTs, bundlers, transpilers, and TypeScript?!

After the initial shock settled down, I took a serious look at the position and got even more excited. My entire development career (dare I say, life?) I've been interested in the exact things that the Staff Software Engineer position is about. I've always been interested in the more going deep into the tools and the low-level parts of the web, I've ventured into open source (although admittedly not as much as I would've liked), I've had a passion for detail and quality and I've been using Tailwind for quite some time while focussing on DX for the teams I've led.

Thank you for taking the time to read my application. Please bear with me while we dive a little deeper into the interests mentioned above.

## Going deep

My interest in development started at a very young age. I think I was around 10 when I started toying with PowerPoint. Yes, PowerPoint was my gateway drug into software development. I discovered you could create links to other slides, so I could present a user with a choice and take them to a different part of the storyline based on the choice they made. Combine this with the ability to create over-the-top animations and I was hooked.

To me, this illustrates that my general interest in using (or abusing) tools to create something new started from a very young age. Paired with a constant curiosity and a desire to understand how things work you might come to understand why software engineering was a natural fit for me.

Skipping through high school (where I taught programming to fellow students), my time studying computer science at [Eindhoven University](https://www.tue.nl/en/), a startup, and 7 years of experience working at agencies, I'm currently leading an innovation project at [Incentro](https://incentro.com/) (my current employer), where we're building a toolset for developers to quickly build headless e-commerce sites.

This project (called `micro.nova`) focuses on reusing the logic between e-commerce sites. So, where Tailwind and Tailwind UI help us with styling, and Headless UI helps us with functionality and accessibility, `micro.nova` will offer a set of reusable components that implement the data fetching and logic parts of an e-commerce site. My day-to-day work now involves working on CLI tools, manipulating GraphQL ASTs, writing extensive documentation, setting up build pipelines (in GH Actions), creating data-fetching tools for React, writing plugins for codegen tools like [GraphQL Codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen), etc.

## Open-source

My developing interests in software engineering have been paired with contributions to open-source software:

- During my startup time, we were working with [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana), to which I made some very small contributions, as well as creating and open-sourcing the basis for an [ElastAlert plugin for Kibana](https://github.com/bitsensor/elastalert-kibana-plugin).
- During my time at ISAAC (another Dutch agency), I created and open-sourced [a caching wrapper for localforage](https://github.com/LuudJanssen/localforage-cache), and [AngularJS bindings for NoUISlider](https://github.com/isaaceindhoven/angularjs-nouislider).
- At Incentro, I open-sourced [an approach to improving localized routing in an older version of Next.js](https://github.com/LuudJanssen/next-locale-router), though I never got the approval from the client to provide suitable open-source licenses.
- I recently created [a plugin for Remark to turn GitHub's alert syntax into admonitions directives](https://github.com/incentro-dc/remark-github-admonitions-to-directives) by simply manipulating the Markdown AST.

Although I'm happy with my contributions to open-source, I've always felt like I could do more. The thought of open-source being a part of my job and making a real impact makes me excited.

## Chasing a "wow"

Whether it's perfecting a PowerPoint by adding interactivity and unexpected animations or using TypeScript generics to create a utility that's a joy to use, I've always been chasing that "wow" moment. That moment when you exceed someone's expectations by just a little bit. That moment when you've put in the extra effort to make something truly special.

Looking at both open positions, as well as the work your team has done, I can't help but feel that you recognize this drive and it's a shared value within the team. Not only do you create tools that work and add real value, but there's a certain amount of elegance and thoughtfulness in the way they were created. This is something I strive for in my work as well.

This drive towards elegance has also forced me to create other skills, like using video editing skills for [an introduction video for the new brand](https://vimeo.com/302102524) of a student association. Or creating sound effects for a very small amateur theater production using FL Studio. Or the time I went overboard with renting equipment for [filming a corporate outing during my time at ISAAC](https://vimeo.com/280936509). Or that time I learned to manipulate SVGs to create customized digital tickets to streaming events:

> This was part of an awesome project where me and a team of 2 other devs created [an entire streaming platform](https://strealix.com/) in 3 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic. It's far from perfect, but I'm proud of it because I managed to do the design, branding and front-end all by myself in 3 weeks.

I wouldn't say these skills are my strong suits, there's a reason I'm applying for the position of Staff Software Engineer, but I do think they highlight that I won't shy away from learning new things (like Rust) and going the extra mile to create something special.
